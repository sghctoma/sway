sway-output(5)

# NAME

sway-output - output configuration commands for sway

# DESCRIPTION

You may combine output commands into one, like so:

	output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 pos 1920,0 bg ~/wallpaper.png stretch

You can get a list of output names with *swaymsg -t get\_outputs*. You may also
match any output by using the output name "\*".

Some outputs may have different names when disconnecting and reconnecting. To
identify these, the name can be substituted for a string consisting of the make,
model and serial which you can get from *swaymsg -t get\_outputs*. Each value
must be separated by one space. For example:

	output "Some Company ABC123 0x00000000" pos 1920,0

# COMMANDS

*output* <name> mode|resolution|res <WIDTHxHEIGHT>[@<RATE>[Hz]]
	Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a
	combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your
	display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each
	output, use *swaymsg -t get\_outputs*.

	Examples:

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz

*output* <name> position|pos <X> <Y>
	Places the specified output at the specific position in the global
	coordinate space. If scaling is active, it has to be considered when
	positioning. For example, if the scaling factor for the left output is 2,
	the relative position for the right output has to be divided by 2. The 
	reference point is the top left corner so if you want the bottoms aligned
	this has to be considered as well.

	Example:

		output HDMI1 scale 2

		output HDMI1 pos 0 1020 res 3200x1800

		output eDP1 pos 1600 0 res 1920x1080

	Note that the left x-pos of eDP1 is 1600 = 3200/2 and the bottom y-pos is 
	1020 + (1800 / 2) = 1920 = 0 + 1920

*output* <name> scale <factor>
	Scales the specified output by the specified scale _factor_. An integer is
	recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional
	value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully
	represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next
	highest integral scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by
	setting an integral scale factor and adjusting the font size of your
	applications to taste. HiDPI isn't supported with Xwayland clients (windows
	will blur).

*output* <name> background|bg <file> <mode> [<fallback\_color>]
	Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the
	given scaling mode (one of "stretch", "fill", "fit", "center", "tile"). If
	the specified file cannot be accessed or if the image does fill the entire
	output, a fallback color may be provided to cover the rest of the output.
	__fallback\_color__ should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not
	supported.

*output* <name> background|bg <color> solid\_color
	Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. _color_
	should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

*output* <name> transform <transform> [clockwise|anticlockwise]
	Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of "90", "180",
	"270" for rotation; or "flipped", "flipped-90", "flipped-180", "flipped-270"
	to apply a rotation and flip, or "normal" to apply no transform. If a single
	output is chosen and a rotation direction is specified 
	(_clockwise_ or _anticlockwise_) then the transform is added or 
	subtracted from the current transform.

*output* <name> disable|enable
	Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by
	default).
