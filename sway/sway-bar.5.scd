sway-bar(5)

# NAME

sway-bar - bar configuration file and commands

# DESCRIPTION

Sway allows configuring swaybar in the sway configuration file.

# COMMANDS

*status\_command* <status command>
	Executes the bar _status command_ with _sh -c_. Each line of text printed
	to stdout from this command will be displayed in the status area of the
	bar. You may also use the i3bar JSON protocol:

	https://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html

	If running this command via IPC, you can disable a running status command by
	setting the command to a single dash: _swaybar bar bar-0 status\_command -_

*pango\_markup* enabled|disabled
	Enables or disables pango markup for status lines. This has no effect on
	status lines using the i3bar JSON protocol.

*id* <bar\_id>
	Sets the ID of the bar.

*position* top|bottom
	Sets position of the bar. Default is _bottom_.

*output* <output>
	Restrict the bar to a certain output, can be specified multiple times. If
	the output command is omitted, the bar will be displayed on all outputs.

*swaybar\_command* <command>
	Executes custom bar command. Default is _swaybar_.

*font* <font>
	Specifies the font to be used in the bar.

*separator\_symbol* <symbol>
	Specifies the separator symbol to separate blocks on the bar.

*wrap\_scroll* yes|no
	Enables or disables wrapping when scrolling through workspaces with the
	scroll wheel. Default is _no_.

*workspace\_buttons* yes|no
	Enables or disables workspace buttons on the bar. Default is _yes_.

*strip\_workspace\_name* yes|no
	If set to _yes_, then workspace names will be omitted from the workspace
	button and only the custom number will be shown. Default is _no_.

*strip\_workspace\_numbers* yes|no
	If set to _yes_, then workspace numbers will be omitted from the workspace
	button and only the custom name will be shown. Default is _no_.

*binding\_mode\_indicator* yes|no
	Enable or disable binding mode indicator. Default is _yes_.

*gaps* <all> | <horizontal> <vertical> | <top> <right> <bottom> <left>
	Sets the gaps from the edge of the screen for the bar. Gaps can either be
	set all at once, per direction, or per side. Note that only sides that
	touch an edge of the screen can have gaps. For the side that does not
	touch an edge of the screen, per-side outer gaps for workspaces may be of
	use.

*height* <height>
	Sets the height of the bar. Default height will match the font size.

*bindsym* [--release] button<n> <command>
	Executes _command_ when mouse button _n_ has been pressed (or if _released_
	is given, when mouse button _n_ has been released). To disable the default
	behavior for a button, use the command _nop_.

*mode* dock|hide|invisible
	Specifies the visibility of the bar. In _dock_ mode, it is permanently
	visible at one edge of the screen. In _hide_ mode, it is hidden unless the
	modifier key is pressed, though this behaviour depends on the hidden state.
	In _invisible_ mode, it is permanently hidden. Default is _dock_.

*hidden\_state* hide|show
	Specifies the behaviour of the bar when it is in _hide_ mode. When the
	hidden state is _hide_, then it is normally hidden, and only unhidden by
	pressing the modifier key or in case of urgency hints. When the hidden
	state is _show_, then it is permanently visible, drawn on top of the
	currently visible workspace. Default is _hide_.

*modifier* <Modifier>|none
	Specifies the modifier key that shows a hidden bar. Default is _Mod4_.

## TRAY

Swaybar provides a system tray where third-party applications may place icons.
The following commands configure the tray.

The _button_ argument in all cases is a platform-specific button code. On Linux
you can find a list of these at linux/input-event-codes.h.

*tray\_bindsym* button<n> ContextMenu|Activate|SecondaryActivate|ScrollDown|ScrollLeft|ScrollRight|ScrollUp|nop
	Binds mouse button _n_ (1 to 9) to the specified action. Use the command
	_nop_ to disable the default action (Activate for button 1, ContextMenu for
	button 2 and SecondaryActivate for button 3).

*tray\_padding* <px> [px]
	Sets the pixel padding of the system tray. This padding will surround the
	tray on all sides and between each item. The default value for _px_ is 2.

*tray\_output* none|<output>
	Restrict the tray to a certain output, can be specified multiple times. If
	omitted, the tray will be displayed on all outputs. Unlike i3bar, swaybar
	can show icons on any number of bars and outputs without races.

*icon\_theme* <name>
	Sets the icon theme that sway will look for item icons in. This option has
	no default value, because sway will always default to the fallback theme,
	hicolor.

## COLORS

Colors are defined within a _colors { }_ block inside a _bar { }_ block. Colors
must be defined in hex: _#RRGGBB_ or _#RRGGBBAA_.

*background* <color>
	Background color of the bar.

*statusline* <color>
	Text color to be used for the statusline.

*separator* <color>
	Text color to be used for the separator.

*focused\_background* <color>
	Background color of the bar on the currently focused monitor output. If not
	used, the color will be taken from _background_.

*focused\_statusline* <color>
	Text color to be used for the statusline on the currently focused monitor
	output. If not used, the color will be taken from _statusline_.

*focused\_separator* <color>
	Text color to be used for the separator on the currently focused monitor
	output. If not used, the color will be taken from _separator_.

*focused\_workspace* <border> <background> <text>
	Border, background and text color for a workspace button when the workspace
	has focus.

*active\_workspace* <border> <background> <text>
	Border, background and text color for a workspace button when the workspace
	is active (visible) on some output, but the focus is on another one. You
	can only tell this apart from the focused workspace when you are using
	multiple monitors.

*inactive\_workspace* <border> <background> <text>
	Border, background and text color for a workspace button when the workspace
	does not have focus and is not active (visible) on any output. This will be
	the case for most workspaces.

*urgent\_workspace* <border> <background> <text>
	Border, background and text color for a workspace button when the workspace
	contains a window with the urgency hint set.

*binding\_mode* <border> <background> <text>
	Border, background and text color for the binding mode indicator. If not used,
	the colors will be taken from _urgent\_workspace_.
