If you are using the nvidia proprietary driver for any reason, you have two choices:

1. Uninstall it and use nouveau instead
2. Use X11+i3 and close your browser tab

If `lsmod | grep nvidia | wc -l` shows anything other than zero, your bug report is not welcome here.

Otherwise, please include the following four components in your bug report: sway version, debug log, configuration (if applicable), and an explanation of steps taken to reproduce the issue. If sway crashes, also include a stack trace.

Obtain your version like so:

    swaymsg -t get_version

If this doesn't work, use:

    sway -v

* Sway Version:

Obtain a debug log like so:

    sway -d 2> ~/sway.log

This will record information about sway's activity when it's running. Briefly reproduce your problem and exit sway.  When preparing a debug log, brevity is important - start up sway, do the minimum work necessary to reproduce the error, then close sway.

Upload the debug log to a pastebin service such as [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com), and link to it below.

* Debug Log:

You should try to reproduce the issue with the default configuration. If you cannot, please reproduce with a minimal configuration, upload the config to a pastebin service, and link to it below.

* Configuration File:

Finally, explain the steps you took in plain English to reproduce the problem below.

* Stack Trace, if sway crashes:

If you use systemd, you should be able to open the coredump of the most recent crash with GDB like so:

    coredumpctl gdb sway

And then type `bt full` to obtain the stack trace.
